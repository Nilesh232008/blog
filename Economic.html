<br> <br>
<strong>
The year was marked by significant global events like the U.S. hitting its debt ceiling in January, huge bank failures such as the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, and the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. On the domestic front, there were stories about soaring tomato prices and six Assembly elections. Those elections and the upcoming Lok Sabha elections in 2024 will be observed keenly by investors for change in government economic policies and reforms.

<br> <br>
<strong>
Although the second quarter’s growth of 7.6% was lower than that of the first quarter’s 7.8%, it was still well over the central bank’s prediction of 6.5%. Overall, India’s GDP has grown at a reasonably impressive pace and India remains the fifth largest economy in the world behind Japan and ahead of the United Kingdom.

<h2>India’s Manufacturing PMI</h2>
<hr style="width: 50%;">
<strong>
Standard & Poor’s Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) is a weighted average of indices constituting new orders, output, employment, suppliers’ delivery times, and stocks of purchases. It indicates the overall health of the economy and its key economic drivers as exports, capacity utilisation, employment and inventories, among other things.
<br> <br>
Throughout 2023, India’s manufacturing PMI remained above 50, signalling an expanding output, with the PMI hitting 56 in November. However, in October, growth eased to the slowest pace since February with the uptick in new orders hitting a one-year low, as the Global India Manufacturing PMI slipped to 55.5 from 57.6 in September.

<h2>India's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI)</h2>
<h3>The PMI, is an economic indicator. It moves around a neutral level of 50, which indicates no change on the prior month. Readings above 50 signals that the economy is expanding and below 50 it is contracting – this allows one to see the economic cycle over time.

<br> <br>
<strong>
Increases in the U.S. Federal interest rates have hindered the rupee’s growth against the dollar. In March this year, the rates were increased by 25 basis points. Such an increase makes investing in American assets less risky, leading investors to move to the dollar from the rupee. However, the Reserve Bank of India has been keeping a tight handle  to limit fluctuations. Central banks play an important role in selling and buying foreign reserves to control the value of the domestic currency against that of the dollar.

<h2> Unemployment rate </h2>
