<h2> About </h2>
<strong>
Hello and welcome to Productive Blogging! My name is Nilesh Pal and I am passionate about helping bloggers fulfil their potential and turn their blogs into successful businesses, without feeling overwhelmed or burning out.
</strong>

<h2><i>Blogging is the process that implies creating articles, photos, and other forms of content and publishing them on a website. Its characteristics include informal language, a laid-back atmosphere, regular updates, lifehacks, tips, and a high level of customer engagement.</i>
</h2><br> 

<strong>
I created this blog as a way to demonstrate the ease with which a writer can blog a nonfiction book. Fiction writers can use many of the same principles to blog novels as well; however, my expertise lies in writing, editing and publishing nonfiction books.
<br><br>
The earlier posts in the blog offer readers information on how they can write their own book via a blog. By reading early posts on the blog, you can follow me along as I blogged my own book—a book about how to blog a book. (Start reading here or use this table of contents to follow along.) The posts offer information based on my knowledge as a freelance nonfiction book editor, writing coach and consultant. That said, this was my first blogged book, so you get to experience the trials and tribulations, the pros and cons, of composing a manuscript and publishing it in this way. (I usually say I was the guinea pig for blogging books!)
<br><br>
Once I finished the book, I began blogging about blogging books, booking blogs (repurposing blog posts into a book) and blogging in general.
<br><br>
How to Blog a Book was published by Writer’s Digest Books, and it became an Amazon bestseller and remained on the Top 100 list in one of three categories for three years. A revised and expanded edition was released just three years later, which immediately became an Amazon bestseller as well.
<br><br>
I have gone on to blog and to book a variety of manuscripts. These have all become Amazon bestsellers as well.
