<h2>What makes Chandrayaan-4 Mission unique?</h2>
<hr style="width: 50%;">
<img src="chandrayyan.jpg" alt="chandrayyan.jpg" width="300" height="300" align="center"/>
<br> <br>
<strong>
After the successful completion of Chandrayaan-3, ISRO is now focusing on Chandrayaan-4, which is a lunar sample-return mission. This involves making a soft landing on the Moon and bringing a sample of lunar rock back to Earth. If successful, India would become the fourth country, following the United States, Russia, and China, to accomplish this feat. The major objectives of the Chandrayaan-4 Mission are to achieve a safe and gentle landing on the lunar surface, collect and store lunar samples, lift off from the Moon's surface, dock and undock in lunar orbit, transfer samples between modules and then return to Earth.
<br> <br>
The strategy for the Chandrayaan-4 Mission is intricate, involving five separate components of the spacecraft—the propulsion system, descender, ascender, transfer module, and re-entry module. This unique approach sets it apart from previous missions and is intended to aid in lunar exploration and the retrieval of samples from the Moon.
<br> <br>
The five payloads or components include the Lunar Propulsion module which is designed to transport the Lunar lander and ascender stage to the Moon, much like the propulsion module used for Chandrayaan-3. There will be lunar lander that will touch down on the Moon carrying instrumentation to support the ascend stage and soil sampling equipment. There will also be a Lunar Module Ascender which, after collecting and storing samples from the Moon, will detach from the lander and take off from the lunar surface, utilizing the lander as a launching platform to enter a low-lunar orbit. It will also have a transfer module that will gather samples from the ascend stage and will transport them to the reentry module, activating its engine to propel both modules towards Earth, releases the payload, and then loop back around the Earth. The reentry module will contain the lunar samples (which is called as Lunar Regolith mixture of rocks and soil) collected from orbit and is built to withstand reentry into Earth's atmosphere, landing safely with the lunar soil.
<br> <br>
“Chandrayaan-4 will be unique in that it will utilize two different rockets: the heavy lifter Launch Vehicle Mark-3 (LMV-3) for carrying most of the payloads, and the dependable work horse Polar Satellite Vehicle (PSLV). These rockets will be launched on different dates, with the earliest launch not expected before 2028. ISRO will utilize two different rockets to launch the components of the spacecraft. The LVM-3 will carry the propulsion, descender, and ascender modules, while the regular PSLV will transport the transfer module and re-entry modules to their designated lower lunar orbits. ISRO is yet to determine the sequence,” explained space expert Girish Linganna.
<br> <br>
He said the the descender module will use a robotic arm to gather lunar samples, which are then transferred to the Ascender Module. The Ascender Module then separates and ascends to lunar orbit to dock with the Transfer Module. This creates a combination of Ascender, Transfer, and Re-entry modules in lunar orbit.
<br> <br>
“The Transfer Module moves the lunar samples from the Ascender Module to the Re-entry Module, then the Ascender Module detaches from the three-part structure (Ascender, Transfer, and Re-entry modules structure). The combined Transfer and Re-entry modules will return to Earth orbit. The Re-entry Module will then detach from the Transfer module in a suitable Earth-bound orbit and re-enter Earth's atmosphere to land safely,” added Linganna.
<br> <br>
The successful docking of the Ascender Module with the Transfer Module in lunar orbit will depend on the completion of the planned Space Docking Experiment (SPADEX). This mission, developed by ISRO, involves two spacecraft and aims to advance technologies for orbital rendezvous (or Orbital Meeting), docking, and formation flying.

<h2>OpenAI's Sam Altman cleared to return to board after probe</h2>
<hr style="width: 50%;">
<img src="one ai.jpg" alt="openai" width="300" height="300" align="center"/>
<br> <br>
<strong>
OpenAI, the renowned artificial intelligence company behind Chat GPT, has announced the clearance of its Chief Executive Officer, Sam Altman, of any wrongdoing, paving the way for his return to the company's board following a monthslong investigation. The inquiry, conducted by law firm WilmerHale, concluded that Altman's dismissal last year was a result of a breakdown in the relationship and loss of trust between him and the prior board, rather than concerns about product safety, development pace, or OpenAI's finances.
<br> <br>
In response to the findings, OpenAI has announced the appointment of three new directors, including Altman, Sue Desmond-Hellmann, Nicole Seligman, and Fidji Simo. The company also revealed the implementation of new governance rules and a strengthened conflict of interest policy, unanimously backed by the board.
<br> <br>
The investigation's findings highlighted that the prior board's actions were intended to mitigate internal management challenges and did not anticipate destabilizing the company. Furthermore, OpenAI has stated the adoption of new corporate governance guidelines, the creation of a whistleblower hotline, and the reinforcement of its conflict-of-interest policy.
<br> <br>
Altman, welcoming the new board members, expressed the importance of the work ahead.

"I am thrilled to announce our new board members: Fidji Simo, Sue Desmond-Hellmann, and Nicole Seligman, and to continue collaborating with Bret, Larry, and Adam," Saltman stated in a post on X.
<br> <br>
"I am grateful to everyone on our team for their resilience and unwavering focus during a challenging period. I especially want to express my gratitude to Mira for our strong partnership and her leadership during difficult times, as well as in all the quieter moments where it truly matters. I also want to acknowledge Greg, whose unique leadership role is indispensable to OpenAI's existence. Being in the trenches is never easy, but having them by my side makes it much more bearable," he added.
<br> <br>
The lack of detail provided by the board at the time of Altman's firing had fueled speculation about potential misconduct, which Altman and the company have denied. His reinstatement as CEO, following widespread employee discontent and resignations from the prior board, sparked discussions about OpenAI's governance, ultimately leading to the announcement of a reconstituted board with Altman's return.

<h2>Study finds new method to calculate carbon emission budget until Paris targets broken</h2>
<hr style="width: 50%;">
<br> <br>

<img src="carbon.jpg" alt="carbons" width="300" height="300" align="center"/>
<br> <br>
<strong>
Scientists have found a new way to calculate the total carbon emissions corresponding to Paris Agreement targets of 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius.

A new study has showed that observed global warming so far and estimated carbon emissions together form a good indicator of the emission budget we are left with before we pass the Paris climate targets.
<br> <br>
Looking at results from all available earth system models, the team of researchers from University of Exeter, Met Office and Imperial College, UK, found that they formed a "lovely straight line" linking emissions per degree Celsius of global warming till now.
<br> <br>
For a given level of future global warming, they could then determine the total amount of carbon emissions, termed as "emergent constraints".
<br> <br>
The findings meant that best estimates of global warming and emissions up to the current day can be converted simply into estimates of the total carbon budget for the Paris climate targets, the researchers said.

The results also help solve the disagreement problem between various earth system models regarding an important question -- how much global warming will we get for a billion tonnes of carbon emissions?
<br> <br>
"This emergent constraint is elegant and powerful. It both uses observations to narrow the possible range of future emissions, but also lets us consider other greenhouse gases than just carbon dioxide. In this way, the remaining carbon budget is made much more policy relevant," said Chris Jones, from the Met Office, and co-author of the study published in the journal Nature Communications.
<br> <br>
The good news is that the latest study estimated emission budgets that are at least 10 per cent larger than the average value for the models, the team said.

However, the bad news is, they said, that if humankind continued emitting carbon at the current rate, we have a little more than a decade before we exceed the Paris 1.5 degrees Celsius target, even for decade-mean warming.
<br> <br>
"Our study clarifies the climate problem that needs to be solved, and we hope that it will stimulate greater efforts to reduce our emissions to Net Zero," said lead author Peter Cox, Director of the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter.

<h2>Mar's role in Earth's climate cycles uncovered</h2>
<hr style="width: 50%;">

<img src="mars.jpg" alt="mars" width="300" height="300" align="center"/>
<br> <br>
<strong>
Our existence is governed by natural cycles, from the daily rhythms of sleeping and eating, to longer patterns such as the turn of the seasons and the quadrennial round of leap years.
<br><br>
After looking at seabed sediment stretching back 65 million years, we have found a previously undetected cycle to add to the list: an ebb and flow in deep sea currents, tied to a 2.4-million-year swell of global warming and cooling driven by a gravitational tug of war between Earth and Mars. Our research is published in Nature Communications.
<br><br>
Milankovitch cycles and ice ages
<br><br>
Most of the natural cycles we know are determined one way or another by Earth's movement around the Sun.
<br><br>
As the German astronomer Johannes Kepler first realised four centuries ago, the orbits of Earth and the other planets are not quite circular, but rather slightly squashed ellipses. And over time, the gravitational jostling of the planets changes the shape of these orbits in a predictable pattern.
<br><br>
These alterations affect our long-term climate, influencing the coming and going of ice ages. In 1941, Serbian astrophysicist Milutin Milankovitch recognised that changes in the shape of Earth's orbit, the tilt of its axis, and the wobbling of its poles all affect the amount of sunlight we receive.
<br><br>
Known as Milankovitch cycles, these patterns occur with periods of 405,000, 100,000, 41,000 and 23,000 years. Geologists have found traces of them throughout Earth's deep past, even in 2.5-billion-year old rocks.
<br><br>
Earth and Mars
<br><br>
There are also slower rhythms, called astronomical grand cycles, which cause fluctuations over millions of years. One such cycle, related to the slow rotation of the orbits of Earth and Mars, recurs every 2.4 million years.
<br><br>
The cycle is predicted by astronomical models, but is rarely detected in geological records. The easiest way to find it would be in sediment samples that continuously cover a period of many millions of years, but these are rare.
<br><br>
Much like the shorter Milankovitch cycles, this grand cycle affects the amount of sunlight Earth receives and has an impact on climate.
<br><br>
Gaps in the record
<br><br>
When we went hunting for signs of these multimillion-year climate cycles in the rock record, we used a big data approach. Scientific ocean drilling data collected since the 1960s have generated a treasure trove of information on deep-sea sediments through time across the global ocean.
<br><br>
In our study, published in Nature Communications, we used sedimentary sequences from more than 200 drill sites to discover a previously unknown connection between the changing orbits of Earth and Mars, past global warming cycles, and the speeding up of deep-ocean currents.
<br><br>
Most studies focus on complete, high-resolution records to detect climate cycles. Instead, we concentrated on the parts of the sedimentary record that are missing breaks in sedimentation called hiatuses.

A deep-sea hiatus indicates the action of vigorous bottom currents that eroded seafloor sediment. In contrast, continuous sediment accumulation indicates calmer conditions.
<br><br>
Analysing the timing of hiatus periods across the global ocean, we identified hiatus cycles over the past 65 million years. The results show that the vigour of deep-sea currents waxes and wanes in 2.4 million year cycles coinciding with changes in the shape of Earth's orbit.
<br><br>
Astronomical models suggest the interaction of Earth and Mars drives a 2.4 million year cycle of more sunlight and warmer climate alternating with less sunlight and cooler climate. The warmer periods correlate with more deep-sea hiatuses, related to more vigorous deep-ocean currents.
<br><br>
Warming and deep currents
<br><br>
Our results fit with recent satellite data and ocean models mapping short-term ocean circulation changes. Some of these suggest that ocean mixing has become more intense over the last decades of global warming.
<br><br>
Deep-ocean eddies are predicted to intensify in a warming, more energetic climate system, particularly at high latitudes, as major storms become more frequent. This makes deep ocean mixing more vigorous.
<br><br>
Deep-ocean eddies are like giant wind-driven whirlpools and often reach the deep sea floor. They result in seafloor erosion and large sediment accumulations called contourite drifts, akin to snowdrifts.
<br><br>
Can Mars keep the oceans alive?
<br><br>
Our findings extend these insights over much longer timescales. Our deep-sea data spanning 65 million years suggest that warmer oceans have more vigorous eddy-driven circulation.
<br><br>
This process may play an important role in a warmer future. In a warming world the difference in temperature between the equator and poles diminishes. This leads to a weakening of the world's ocean conveyor belt.
<br><br>
In such a scenario, oxygen-rich surface waters would no longer mix well with deeper waters, potentially resulting in a stagnant ocean. Our results and analyses of deep ocean mixing suggest that more intense deep-ocean eddies may counteract such ocean stagnation.
<br><br>
How the Earth-Mars astronomical influence will interact with shorter Milankovitch cycles and current human-driven global warming will largely depend on the future trajectory of our greenhouse gas emissions.
